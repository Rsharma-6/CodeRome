# 💻 CodeRome — Real-Time Collaborative Code Editor

**CodeRome** is a real-time collaborative coding platform built with **React**, **Node.js**, and **Socket.IO**.  
It allows multiple users to join a shared coding room, write code together, run it, and see synchronized outputs instantly — all in the browser.

## 🚀 Features

- ⚡ **Real-time collaboration with yjs:** All users in a room can edit code simultaneously, and Yjs uses CRDTs to merge changes instantly without conflicts.  
- 🔄 **Live code & output sync:** Both **code** and **compiler output** are synchronized across all users in the same room — everyone sees the same result after a compilation.  
- 🔔 **User join/leave notifications:** When a user joins or leaves the room, all participants get instant on-screen notifications.  
- 🆔 **Unique Room ID (UUID):** Each room is created with a unique **UUID**, ensuring every coding session is distinct and securely identified.  
- 💬 **Room-based sessions:** Users can join existing rooms or create new ones for separate coding sessions.  
- 🧑‍💻 **Multi-language support:** Run code in various languages using the **JDoodle API**
- 🪶 **Modern and clean UI:** Built with React and Bootstrap for a smooth, dark-themed experience.
